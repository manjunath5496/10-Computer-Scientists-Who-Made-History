<p><strong>Alan Mathison Turing</strong>&nbsp;<span class="noexcerpt nowraplinks"><a class="mw-redirect" title="Officer of the Order of the British Empire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire">OBE</a>&nbsp;<a title="Fellow of the Royal Society" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society">FRS</a></span>&nbsp;(<span class="rt-commentedText nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups noexcerpt"><a title="Help:IPA/English" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">/<span title="/ˈ/: primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="/tj/: 't' in 'tune'">tj</span><span title="/ʊər/: 'our' in 'tour'">ʊər</span><span title="/ɪ/: 'i' in 'kit'">ɪ</span><span title="/ŋ/: 'ng' in 'sing'">ŋ</span>/</a></span></span>; 23 June 1912&nbsp;&ndash; 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician,&nbsp;<a title="Computer scientist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist">computer scientist</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Logic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logician</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Cryptanalysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis">cryptanalyst</a>, philosopher, and&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical and theoretical biology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology">theoretical biologist</a>.&nbsp;Turing was highly influential in the development of&nbsp;<a title="Theoretical computer science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical computer science</a>, providing a formalisation of the concepts of&nbsp;<a title="Algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Computation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation">computation</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a title="Turing machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>, which can be considered a model of a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="General-purpose computer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computer">general-purpose computer</a>.&nbsp;Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and&nbsp;<a title="Artificial intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.&nbsp;Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of&nbsp;<a title="Homophobia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia">homophobia</a>&nbsp;<a title="Timeline of LGBT history in the United Kingdom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_LGBT_history_in_the_United_Kingdom#20th_century">at the time</a>&nbsp;and because much of his work was covered by the&nbsp;<a title="Official Secrets Act" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act">Official Secrets Act</a>.</p>
<p>During the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Second World War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War">Second World War</a>, Turing worked for the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Government Communications Headquarters" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters#Government_Code_and_Cypher_School_(GC&amp;CS)">Government Code and Cypher School</a>&nbsp;(GC&amp;CS) at&nbsp;<a title="Bletchley Park" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley Park</a>, Britain's&nbsp;<a title="Cryptanalysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis">codebreaking</a>&nbsp;centre that produced&nbsp;<a title="Ultra" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra">Ultra</a>&nbsp;intelligence. For a time he led&nbsp;<a title="Hut 8" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8">Hut 8</a>, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German&nbsp;<a title="Cipher" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">ciphers</a>, including improvements to the pre-war Polish&nbsp;<a title="Bomba (cryptography)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_(cryptography)">bombe</a>&nbsp;method, an&nbsp;<a title="Electromechanics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics">electromechanical</a>&nbsp;machine that could find settings for the&nbsp;<a title="Enigma machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma machine</a>.</p>
<p>Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the&nbsp;<a title="Battle of the Atlantic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, and in so doing helped win the war. Due to the problems of&nbsp;<a title="Counterfactual history" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_history">counterfactual history</a>, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war,&nbsp;but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14&nbsp;million lives.</p>
<p>After the war Turing worked at the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="National Physical Laboratory, UK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory,_UK">National Physical Laboratory</a>, where he designed the&nbsp;<a title="Automatic Computing Engine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Computing_Engine">Automatic Computing Engine</a>. The Automatic Computing Engine was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined&nbsp;<a title="Max Newman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Newman">Max Newman</a>'s&nbsp;<a title="Computing Machine Laboratory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machine_Laboratory">Computing Machine Laboratory</a>, at the&nbsp;<a title="Victoria University of Manchester" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_University_of_Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a>, where he helped develop the&nbsp;<a title="Manchester computers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_computers">Manchester computers</a>&nbsp;and became interested in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Mathematical biology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_biology">mathematical biology</a>. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of&nbsp;<a title="Morphogenesis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a>&nbsp;and predicted&nbsp;<a title="Chemical clock" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_clock">oscillating</a>&nbsp;<a title="Chemical reaction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction">chemical reactions</a>&nbsp;such as the&nbsp;<a title="Belousov&ndash;Zhabotinsky reaction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction">Belousov&ndash;Zhabotinsky reaction</a>, first observed in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the&nbsp;<a title="Labouchere Amendment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labouchere_Amendment">Labouchere Amendment</a>&nbsp;of 1885 had mandated that "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted&nbsp;<a title="Chemical castration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration">chemical castration</a>&nbsp;treatment, with&nbsp;<a title="Diethylstilbestrol" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol">DES</a>, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from&nbsp;<a title="Cyanide poisoning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a>. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.</p>
<p>In 2009, following an&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Internet campaign" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_campaign">Internet campaign</a>, British Prime Minister&nbsp;<a title="Gordon Brown" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown">Gordon Brown</a>&nbsp;made an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Government_apology_and_pardon_support">official public apology</a>&nbsp;on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated".&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Queen Elizabeth II" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>&nbsp;granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "<a title="Alan Turing law" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_law">Alan Turing law</a>" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.</p>
